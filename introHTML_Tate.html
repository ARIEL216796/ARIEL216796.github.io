  My name is Daniece Tate. I am 24 years old. From what I can remember, I had a stint with web application development in the second grade. Of course, now, that feels like the language of Latin to me. My expectations are to learn the needed material without getting too stressed between assignments because of my lack of experience. It would be great if I could connect with peers in this class who maybe have the same questions as me. Or, it would be great to find peers who are more experienced and can offer guidance without me having to pester the teacher all the time. With the skills I will be learning maybe I can create a website for an upcoming clothing boutique. My favorite hobbies are listening to music, reading books and learning movie/ tv trivia. I am also a fun fact nerd. In my free time I enjoy going for walks at night, reading to my four-year-old son and catching up with family and friends who are back home in St. Louis.
